*   Definition rewrite.
*   Keep noodling over simple & robust `standardizeCon`.
*   Rework the plugin for use directly by GHC, without the hermit REPL.
*   Connect with rest of compiler.
*   Generate circuits again, but *much* larger this time.
*   Blog.


*   Look for faster implementation of `simplifyWithLetFloatingR`.
*   Try simplifying the signatures of `abst'` and `repr'` (and maybe `abst`and `repr`) to hide the `Eq#`.
*   Figure out how `unfoldPoly` sometimes captures value arguments, and fix it.
*   Detect external polymorphism and fail with a message.
